# GEM_TENDER_AUTOMATION
Automating the tender acquisition process using Selenium

SA India is a group of service companies that offers Workforce to various government and private organisations in various sectors, ranging from Security to Housekeeping to Data Entry Operations. The tender acqusition process has been digitized and is carried out at the Government-E-Marketplace portal, and involves a bunch of document uploads and few checkboxes. This program is an attempt to automate that process. Although the program might not remain fully compatible with future versions of the website due to changes in div structures and web-page design, it is nice little project that I developed while  trying to help out my Mom.
